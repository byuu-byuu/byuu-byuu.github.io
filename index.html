      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Win Hnin Hlaing. I enjoy learning about web development, C++ programming,
        and database systems. I like building small projects, trying out different tools,
        and improving my skills step by step.
      </p>
      <p>
        This portfolio is part of my university scholarship application, and I created it to show
        the work I’ve done, both individually and with my group. I’m still learning, but I’m
        excited to continue studying computer science and explore more about how software and websites are built.
